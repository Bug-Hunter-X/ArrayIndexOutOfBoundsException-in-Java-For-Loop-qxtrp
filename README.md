This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException caused by an off-by-one error in a for loop.  The bug.java file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.java provides the corrected version.  The error arises from using the '<=' operator instead of '<' in the loop's conditional statement, causing an attempt to access an element outside the array's bounds.  This example is useful for illustrating the importance of careful array indexing and understanding loop termination conditions.
